- 😄 Pronouns: I smile well, listen to people well, and very social! I think my specialty is to make two friends when I get close. Come to think of it, I often think I look like a chameleon! The reason seems to be that I usually act according to the environment! What I always want to have fun living is my life history! XD
- ⚡ Fun fact: It's fun because I have to study English, develop it, and have a lot to do!😂
